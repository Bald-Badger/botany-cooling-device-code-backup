# botany-cooling-device-code-backup
this is the code back up (as well as instructions) of the cooling device I've been working on for Dr. Barker
step 1, install arduino software (windows 10 only) 
  1. go to Microsoft Store (should be in your computer)
  2. search for Arduino
  3. download it
  
step 2, get to know about Arduino (recommended)
  some useful links:
  1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL34zDTPkcs
  2. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage
  
step 3, add your code 
  1. download the "SimpleDHT" floder, place it in your arduino library floder
     the path should looks like something like this: C:\Users\GeniusBadger\Documents\Arduino\libraries
  2. download the "Ver3" folder, put it to anywhere you want
  
step 4, use the code
  1. go into the Ver3 folder you just downloaded, go into there, doulbe click on the Ver3.ino, arduino software should pop out
